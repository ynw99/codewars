# My Codewars Repo
Hello all.

I use this repo to document my code on the [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). My main programming language is Python. However, I can also write some basic codes in programming languages like C/C++, Kotlin, Javascript. If you are interested in adding me to be a friend [click here](https://www.codewars.com/users/ynw99).

See you there. :D
