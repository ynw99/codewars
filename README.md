# My Codewars Repo
Hello all.

I use this repo to document my code on the codewars.com website. My main programming language is Python. However, I can also do some basics in programming languages like C/C++, Kotlin, Javascript. If you are interested in adding me to be a friend [click here](https://www.codewars.com/users/ynw99).

See you there. :D
